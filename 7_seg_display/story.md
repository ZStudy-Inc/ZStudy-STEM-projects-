Seven-Segment Countdown

A local tech startup is hosting a hackathon, and the challenge is to design a device that can count down from a given number, such as a timer for events, games, or even for kitchen use. 
    You gladly join ;) the competition with a team of friends and decide to build a simple yet effective countdown timer using a seven-segment display. 

This project will help you grasp the essentials of working with digital displays and understanding how to control them programmatically, laying the foundation for more complex timing mechanisms.
