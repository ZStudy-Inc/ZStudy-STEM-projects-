Blinking LED

The Zambia National STEM Council is hosting a series of workshops for children to introduce them to electronics and programming. They reach out to you because you are a popular figure in the STEM world.
you gladly accept their request. :)
Now as part of the workshop, you decide to use the friendly zstudy STEM kit and  start with the simplest project to spark their interest: "the blinking LED". 


This project serves as the perfect introduction to the basics of circuits and programming, showing how a small piece of code can bring an electronic component to life.
