The Buzzer Beep Pattern

At the Lusaka Engineering Company (LENCO), safety is paramount. With heavy machinery operating around the clock, thereâ€™s a need for a simple yet effective alert system to notify workers of potential hazards. 
Management is on your neck, they demand innovative safty solutions.

Your solution? "A Rhythm for Safety", A rhythmic buzzer system that catches attention with its distinct pattern of beeps. 
As the lead engineer, you design this alert system. The goal is to create a sequence of beeps that can be recognized by workers even in noisy environments, ensuring they are alerted to any critical situations.

You decide on a pattern: the buzzer will emit a beep every 1 second, followed by a longer beep every 2 seconds, and finally an even longer beep every 3 seconds. This sequence will continue in a loop, providing a consistent and recognizable alert.

This project serves as a foundation for creating more complex safety systems, demonstrating how a simple sound pattern can be crucial in maintaining a safe and efficient working environment.
