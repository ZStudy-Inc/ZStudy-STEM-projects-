Simple Object Detection System

A small robotics team is preparing for an upcoming competition where the task is to design a robot capable of navigating through an obstacle course. 
the team leader reaches out to you, he asks you to hop on the team and improve the robot design and functionalites.One of the essential features of the robot is its ability to detect objects in its path and avoid them. 
            You gladly take on the role of designing the object detection system, focusing on simplicity and reliability. :-)
            
This project introduces the basic concepts of sensors and system responsiveness, providing a stepping stone towards more advanced robotics projects.
