# Auto Object Detection System Using Ultrasonic Sensor on the zstudy STEM kit 

This project demonstrates an automatic object detection system that can be used in various applications such as obstacle avoidance, distance measurement, and automated alert systems. 
The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of objects and measures the distance to them.

 # Components Used
-       Arduino UNO 
-       Ultrasonic Sensor
-       Buzzer 
-       jumper Wires

 # How It Works
The ultrasonic sensor sends out a sound wave at a frequency above human hearing.
This sound wave travels through the air, and if it hits an object, it bounces back to the sensor. The Arduino measures the time it takes for the sound wave to return and calculates the distance to the object based on this time.

 # Notes
- The threshold distance for object detection can be adjusted to suit the desired sensitivity.
- The delay can be modified to change the frequency of readings.
- The buzzer is used for alerting purposes. which is detecting the an object in this case 

# Conclusion
This STEM kit  project is perfect for you  to learn about using ultrasonic sensors with `z study stem kit ` and automating systems based on object detection.
