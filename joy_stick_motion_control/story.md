# The Joystick Reader       -`Navigating New Realms`

In a futuristic world, in desparate years after the nuclear distruction of the earth. You are part of a team of engineers developing a new type of interactive control system for an advanced rover destined to explore uncharted terrains on distant planets, for the a new human habitat. 
The mission's success depends on precise and intuitive control of the rover, and you are responsible for creating the joystick interface that will allow astronauts to navigate the rover with ease.

The joystick must be able to detect subtle movements to ensure that the rover can make delicate maneuvers, avoiding obstacles and traversing difficult landscapes. Additionally, the joystick's button will be used to execute critical commands, making it a vital component of the system.

This project simulates the basic functionality of the joystick, allowing you to read its position and button state. It provides the foundation for more complex control systems, where accuracy and responsiveness are key to successful navigation in challenging environments.
