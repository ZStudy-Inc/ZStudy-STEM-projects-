Joystick Control with Arduino

This project demonstrates how to read the position of a joystick and the state of its button using an Arduino uno on the th eSTEM kit.
The joystick has two analog axes (X and Y) and a digital button. 
The analog axes are connected to the Arduino's analog pins[ ], while the button is connected to a digital pin[ ].
The Arduino reads these inputs and prints the joystick positions and button state to the Serial Monitor.

 Components Used
- Zstudy stem kit [arduino]
- Joystick module with X, Y axes, and a button
- jumper wires

 How It Works
1. Joystick Module:
   - The joystick module consists of two potentiometers (one for the X-axis and one for the Y-axis) and a button. 
   Moving the joystick changes the resistance of the potentiometers, resulting in varying analog values that can be read by the Arduino.
   - The button on the joystick is a simple push-button that can be read as a digital input.
   Notes
   - The joystick's X and Y positions are represented by analog values ranging from 0 to 1023.
   - The button state is represented by digital values: `0` (pressed) and `1` (not pressed).
   - You can adjust the delay in the `loop` function to change the frequency of updates to the Serial or seven segment Monitor.

2. ZStudy STEM kit [Arduino uno]:
   - Reads the analog values from the joystick's X and Y axes using the `analogRead` function.
   - Reads the digital value from the joystick's button using the `digitalRead` function.
   - Prints the read values to the Serial Monitor.

 Circuit Diagram
- Connect the joystick's X-axis output to Arduino analog pin A2.
- Connect the joystick's Y-axis output to Arduino analog pin A1.
- Connect the joystick's button output to Arduino digital pin 8.
- Connect the joystick's VCC to Arduino 5V and GND to Arduino GND.

 How to Use
1. Upload the Code: 
   Upload the provided code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
2. Open the Serial Monitor: 
   Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to observe the joystick's X and Y     positions and the button state in real time.

 
 Conclusion
This project is a simple and effective way to learn about reading analog and digital inputs using the ZStudy STEM kit. 
It can be expanded to control other components or perform specific actions based on the joystick's movements and button presses.
