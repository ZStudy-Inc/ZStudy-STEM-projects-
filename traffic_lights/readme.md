TRAFFIC LIGHTS SYSTEM 

AIM 
To simulate a traffic light system using 3  LEDs with zstudy stem kit

Zstudy stem board
3mm X 3 LEDs (red,yellow,reeen)
jumper wires 

WIRING 

conect the red, yellow and green LEDs to digital pin 9,11 and 10 respectively on the ZStudy stem board. connect the negative legs of all LEDs to the ground of the stem board.

CODE EXPLANATION AND SOURCE 
A traffic system is designed to control the flow of traffic at intersections. the system includes a set of lights that changes colours to indicate when drivers should stop, yeld or go. 
the pins are set to OUTPUT in the code, in the loop function we turn one LED on while keeping the rest off for a specified delay. afer which we separately do the same for the remaining LEDs 

REAL WORLD APPLICATION
