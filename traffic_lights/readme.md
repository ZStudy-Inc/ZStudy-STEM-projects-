to demonstrate flow control using the ZStudy STEM kit 
#TRAFFIC LIGHT SIMULATION 

    -using red,orange and green single LEDs
    -using the ZStudy kits, digital pins 

    #connection 
        -connect the LEDs to the STEM kits digital outputs 
        -ground each of the LEDs 

 #how it works 
    - turn the LEDs on and of using the digitalWrite function 
    -control how long each LEDs stays on or off using the delay function
