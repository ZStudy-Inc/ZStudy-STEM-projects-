Traffic Lights

Chipata is a rapidly growing city, traffic management has become a crucial issue. The chipata city council has  decided to modernize their outdated traffic signal systems to reduce congestion and improve safety. You, as a young engineer, are tasked with developing a prototype for a new traffic light system. 
The goal is to create an efficient and reliable system that can adapt to different traffic conditions and be easily scalable across the city. 
    you gladly take up the task :)



This project simulates a basic traffic light system, allowing you to understand the fundamentals of traffic control technology using the zstudy stem kit.
